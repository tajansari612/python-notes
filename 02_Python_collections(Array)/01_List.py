#Python Lists are just like dynamically sized arrays, 
# declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java).
# In simple language, a list is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas. 
l1 = [1,3,5,7,9,4,3,2,5];
l2 = ["taj","ayaj","raj","pravin"];
print(l1);
print(l2);
print(type(l1))

#IMP notes
#01 List items are indexed
print(l2[0]);
print(l2[1]);
print(l2[2]);

#02 Oredered means in which order items are inserted they follow the same order
