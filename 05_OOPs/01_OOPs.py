# In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that
# uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world
# entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the 
# programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions 
# that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code 
# can access this data.

# Why to use OOPs in python
#01 Helps to mimic real world entities and their properties
#02 Code reausablility
#03 Organization and maintainability of code


#OOPs Concepts in Python
#01 Class
#02 Objects
#03 Polymorphism
#04 Encapsulation
#05 Inheritance
#06 Data Abstraction


#01 Class
# A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the 
# prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity 
# that contains some attributes and methods.
